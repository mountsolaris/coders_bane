# CODERS'BANE

CODERS'BANE is my entry for a Bad UI Challenge as part of my developer training at CODERS.BAY Vienna . The goal was to create a website that is as counterintuitive and user-unfriendly as possible – while still being fully functional.

---

## Project Description
CODERS'BANE is a parody of software bootcamps and features a mix of:
- **Outdated designs**: Frames like it's 1999. Well, almost. I've used iframes, but all the good downsides (scroll bar?!) remain.
- **Unsettling features**: e.g., a not-quite-beautiful background video and an animated GIF that just won't go away.

The website creates a mildly disturbing and irritating user experience. However, all forms on the site can be successfully submitted – functionality is a key aspect of this project.

## Features
- **Bad UI and Bad UX combined:** 
  - The goal was not just to create an inconvenient site but also a deeply unsettling experience.
- **Frames reimagined:** 
  - Noone should use frames so of course I have implemented them as iframes.
- **Fully functional and bug-free:** 
  - All forms work "flawlessly" and are satisfyingly annoying.
- **Random Password Generator**
  - I prefer using an ASCII-based array of numbers and convert them to characters on the fly instead of defining an array of strings beforehand.
- **Fully responsive**
  - It works as intended on smaller screens.

## Technologies
- **HTML**
  - Notably so in the responsive version.
- **CSS**
  - For background videos mostly.
- **Bootstrap**
  - The design is very generic so it just felt right to give it a little Bootstrap magic without getting entangled in Bootstrap JS.  
- **JavaScript**
  - Contrary to common best practice, there are no separate .js files. The features are exclusive to one document, so embedding them makes them easily accessible.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coders-bane.git
   ```
2. Open any of the HTML files in a browser to test the website locally.

## Why CODERS'BANE?
The website demonstrates the importance of good UX/UI design via the lack of it. At worst, it serves as a cautionary example and an entertaining parody of bad design practices. At best, it will haunt you in your dreams And it's obviously a pun.
