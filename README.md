# CODERS'BANE

CODERS'BANE is my entry for a Bad UI Challenge as part of my developer training. The goal was to create a website that is as counterintuitive and user-unfriendly as possible – while still being fully functional.

---

## Project Description
CODERS'BANE is a parody of software bootcamps and features a mix of:
- **Outdated designs**: Frames, modernized as iframes.
- **Unsettling modern features**: e.g., background videos and a password generator.

The website combines bad UI and UX to create a disturbing and irritating user experience. However, all forms on the site can be successfully submitted – functionality is a key aspect of this project.

---

## Features
- **Bad UI and Bad UX combined:** 
  - The goal was not just to create an inconvenient site but also a deeply unsettling experience.
- **Frames reimagined:** 
  - Frames were modernized and implemented as iframes.
- **Fully functional and bug-free:** 
  - All forms work flawlessly.
- **Basic Bootstrap:** 
  - The design is based on Bootstrap without using Bootstrap JS.
- **Inline JavaScript:** 
  - All scripts are embedded directly within the HTML files, contrary to common best practices.

---

## Technologies
- **HTML** (with embedded JavaScript)
- **CSS**
- **Bootstrap** (for basic design)

---

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coders-bane.git
   ```
2. Open any of the HTML files in a browser to test the website locally.

## Why CODERS'BANE?
The website demonstrates the importance of good UX/UI design. It serves as a cautionary example and an entertaining parody of bad design practices.
